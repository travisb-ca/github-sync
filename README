Simple scripts to mirror a portion of a Subversion repository to github.

Originally taken from http://www.icoretech.org/2009/08/how-to-mirror-a-svn-repository-on-github/

Setup:
Before the first repository can be synced you need to create an ssh key
specifically for syncing:

ssh-keygen -t dsa -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa_github_for_mirror

Then you need to add the following entry to ~/.ssh/config:

Host githubmirror
User git
Hostname github.com
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa_github_mirror

Finally you need to add this key to your github account:

cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa_github_mirror.pub

Then you are ready to sync projects.


Initial Sync:

Before beginning you need to create a new repository on github with the project name. Then you perform the initial sync with the following command:

mirror.sh github_username projname svn://svn/path

This will create and initially sync the project. You will see a new directory and git repo named projname. 

Syncing later:

The sync.sh script goes through every directory in the current directory and syncs them first with the SVN repo and then github. It takes no arguments.
